How to compile the JPEG XT reference software with GNU-Make
------------------------------------------------------------

Open "Makefile.template". This is the topmost makefile that contains
compiler and linker commands. Adapt this makefile to your environment,
specifically edit in the "CXX" variable for the C++ compiler that
currently selects GNU g++ version 4.7. Do NOT edit the "Makefile".

To built the final distribution, use
$ make final
For a debug setup, run
$ make debug
The default make target is the "debug" target, so beware!

Additional make targets can be obtained by

$ make help
